Here is the description of our models.
1. The file named "hyperparameter_tuning_keras.ipynb" is the Keras tuner notebook file. To run this we must specify the location of the dataset. The name of the dataset used for this notebook is "Ours".
2. The file named "Our-keras-tuner-model1.ipynb" is the model proposed by Keras tuner. To run this we must specify the location of the dataset. The name of the dataset used for this notebook is "Ours". Also, at the model checkpoint, we should provide the path to shave the model weights and we have to give the same path to load the model. To see the predicted nutrition values, the CSV file "nutrition.csv" should be in the same folder with dataset.
3. The file named "keras_tuner_suggested_ with image data generator.ipynb" is the model proposed by Keras tuner with data augmentation. To run this we must specify the location of the dataset. The name of the dataset used for this notebook is "Ours". Also, at the model checkpoint, we should provide the path to shave the model weights and we have to give the same path to load the model. To see the predicted nutrition values, the CSV file "nutrition.csv" should be in the same folder with dataset.
